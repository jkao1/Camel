#How to Use Squirrel

Squirrel's basic functionality works as any other spreadsheet editor: click to choose a cell, and then enter in a value. Cells can take in any values, even characters, but only numbers will run the graphs.

To enter the ranges for the graphs, you must use the notation [startCol][startRow]:[endCol][endRow]. This tells the program where to start reading the data from and where to end.
